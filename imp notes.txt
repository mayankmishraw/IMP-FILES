logistic regression predict string outputs as well therefore its not necessary to convert those into numbers unlike linear regression

if there is string input in logistic regression we use natural language processing to convert that string into machine understanding languages 
trhat is nymber by using countvectorizer,tfidftranformer or tfidfvectorizer(countvectorizer+tfidftransformer).

pipeline method is very fast compare to single algorithms
eg.
pipeline(tfidfvectorizer +logistic regression) is faster then separate methods of these two
